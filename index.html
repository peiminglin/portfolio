                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p> My name is Peiming Lin, but you can call me Alex. I'm currently living in Sydney and I love to code and design. 
                    I'm finishing my Games Development Degree by the end of 2019 and should be graduated soon. 
                    As such a rational person, I always think with a logical mind. I guess this is why I like coding. 
                    I like to solve puzzles too. So I got a strong problem-solving skill.</p>

                <p> I also like creative stuff. It's so fun to see those new ideas that people could but never thought about. 
                    These ideas show different perspectives of the world around us but we just couldn't see it all. 
                    So making games that could wow people and inspiring them, also bring them enjoyment is what I really wanted to do.</p>

                <p> During the study in UTS, I got quite nice marks (Over 85 on average), especially in programming-related subjects. 
                    I also worked at the University as a tutor teaching some programming subjects since I was in year 2. 
                    Now I'm looking for a job that I can use my coding skill for. If you think we can work together, please contact me.</p>

                            <p>This is the last University project, made by 4 Games Developments students and 2 Music & Sounds Design students. The project won The Best Video Game Award in <a href="http://www.gamesstudio.org/articles/feit-student-prototype-exhibition-spring-2019" target="_blank">UTS FEIT student prototype exhibition spring 2019</a>.</p>

                            <p>Wandering Jack is a Cute 2D platform, action-adventure game based on a space background. Player control a cat, jumping among the planets and collect pieces to escape.</p>
                            <p>The project was created by a 4 members team. I was the team leader/manager and main programmer. The game was based on a physic system that I created to keep the player attracted by the planets.</p>
                            <p>A funny thing for me in the development was that the way I did for parallel space effect was from a dream I made during the project.</p>

                            <p>Little Planet was a computer graphic project that made with Three.js. User can use the keyboard to move around the planet or use the mouse to change the terrain. Through the control panel, user can also change the appearance of the planet, like colors, sand/snow/forest levels, temperature, terrain and etc.</p>
                            <p>My main contribution in this project was the camera control and the cinematic mode. To make it easier to control, the left/right keys will act differently depends on the distance.</p>

                            <p>The game was originally called Plato's Labyrinth and changed to Pursuit later. It was created on a 32-hours <a href="https://itch.io/jam/uts-student-game-jam-2018" target="_blank">University Game Jam</a> in 2018.</p>
                            <p>The idea was inspired by a flash game I played when I was a kid. I thought it was perfect for the theme which was "Changing Perspective". The levels were quite hard to design in a short time, so I even make a level design tool after the Game Jam finished, just in case I want to complete this game later.</p>
                            <p>This game got The Most Challenging Game Award.</p>

                            <p>There is only 1 level in this game. Player uses the keyboard to move and attack enemies. I created a combating system similar to the fighting games that player can press a sequence of keys to perform a combo or a fighting move.</p>
